          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Prithvi Raj. I am a final year CS Undergrad currently interning as a Product Management and Growth Intern at Betafi, a Singapore based Saas Startup. I have previously interned at a Ed-tech startup as well as a Product Growth Intern. I have always been fascinated by tech, and after a long break from coding when I was exploring things like Product Management (still am), I have resumed coding again. This is my first shot at that.</p>
